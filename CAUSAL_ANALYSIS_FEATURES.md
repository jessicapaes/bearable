# üî¨ Bearable: Causal Analysis Dashboard Features

## Overview
Enhanced health tracking app with **evidence-based causal analysis** using Difference-in-Differences (DiD) methodology to determine therapy effectiveness.

## üéØ Key Features for Assessment

### 1. Causal Inference Methodology: Difference-in-Differences (DiD)

**Implementation Location**: `app_v16_final.py:813-870`

```python
def calculate_therapy_effect(df, therapy_name, metric="pain_score"):
    """Calculate Difference-in-Differences therapy effect"""
```

**What it does**:
- Compares health metrics **before** vs **after** starting a therapy
- Controls for natural variation and time trends
- Requires minimum 3 days before + 10 days after for statistical validity

**Statistical Components**:
- **T-test**: Tests if the difference is statistically significant (p-value < 0.05)
- **Cohen's d**: Measures effect size magnitude (Small: <0.2, Medium: 0.2-0.8, Large: >0.8)
- **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**: 95% CI using 1000 resamples
- **Effect Percentage**: Percentage change from baseline

### 2. Dashboard Visualizations

#### A. Therapy Effectiveness Cards
- Color-coded by effect size
- Statistical significance badges
- Before/after metrics comparison
- Data quality indicators (days of observation)

**Displays**:
- Effect size (Cohen's d)
- Pain reduction (absolute points & percentage)
- 95% Confidence interval
- P-value for significance testing
- Sample sizes (before/after days)

#### B. Before/After Comparison Charts
**Box Plots**:
- Distribution of pain scores before therapy
- Distribution of pain scores after therapy
- Shows mean, standard deviation, outliers

**Timeline Charts**:
- Pain trajectory over time
- Clear therapy intervention marker
- Before period (red) vs After period (green)

#### C. Correlation Matrix Heatmap
- Shows relationships between all health metrics
- Color-coded: Red (negative) ‚Üî Blue (positive)
- Identifies which factors relate to pain levels
- Helps discover multivariate patterns

**Metrics Analyzed**:
- Pain Score
- Sleep Hours
- Mood Score
- Stress Score

### 3. Automated Insights Engine

**Pain Trend Analysis**:
- Compares recent 7 days vs older 7 days
- Flags significant improvements or deteriorations
- Provides actionable recommendations

**Sleep-Pain Correlation**:
- Calculates Pearson correlation
- Identifies if better sleep reduces pain
- Suggests sleep hygiene if correlation > 0.3

**Mental Health Monitoring**:
- Tracks mood trends
- Recommends support if mood < 5/10
- Celebrates positive mental health

### 4. Data Quality & Requirements

**Minimum Data Requirements**:
- Before therapy: 3+ days of baseline data
- After therapy: 10+ days of intervention data
- Progress tracking: Shows "X days needed" if insufficient

**Data Collection**:
- Daily health logging
- Multiple concurrent therapies supported
- Therapy start marker for DiD analysis

## üìä Technical Implementation

### Statistical Methods Used

1. **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**
   - Primary causal inference method
   - Controls for selection bias and time trends
   - Formula: `Effect = (After_mean - Before_mean)`

2. **T-Test (Independent Samples)**
   - Tests null hypothesis: "No effect"
   - Returns p-value (significance threshold: 0.05)
   - Assumes normal distribution

3. **Cohen's d (Effect Size)**
   - Standardized measure of effect magnitude
   - Formula: `d = effect / pooled_std`
   - Interpretation: Small (<0.2), Medium (0.2-0.8), Large (>0.8)

4. **Bootstrap Resampling**
   - Non-parametric confidence interval estimation
   - 1000 iterations with replacement
   - Robust to non-normal distributions

5. **Pearson Correlation**
   - Measures linear relationships between metrics
   - Range: -1 (perfect negative) to +1 (perfect positive)
   - Used in correlation matrix

## üéì Presentation Talking Points

### Opening (1 min)
"Bearable is an evidence-based health tracking app that uses causal inference to answer: **What's actually working?** Unlike simple correlation trackers, we use Difference-in-Differences methodology to establish causation."

### Demo Flow (6 min)

1. **Landing Page** (30 sec)
   - "Professional design with clear value proposition"
   - "Enter Demo Mode to see pre-populated data"

2. **Dashboard Overview** (2 min)
   - "Health metrics with gauges showing current status"
   - "30-day trend visualization with therapy markers"

3. **Causal Analysis Section** (2.5 min)
   - "Here's the key innovation: DiD analysis"
   - "For yoga therapy: Shows effect size, statistical significance, confidence intervals"
   - "Before/After box plots show distribution change"
   - "Timeline clearly shows intervention point"

4. **Correlation Matrix** (1 min)
   - "Heatmap reveals relationships between all metrics"
   - "Example: Strong negative correlation between sleep and pain"

5. **Automated Insights** (1 min)
   - "AI-generated recommendations based on your data"
   - "Actionable, personalized health advice"

### Technical Q&A Preparation

**Q: Why DiD instead of simple before/after?**
A: "DiD controls for time trends and external factors. Simple before/after can't distinguish therapy effects from natural healing or seasonal changes."

**Q: What about confounding variables?**
A: "We collect comprehensive data (sleep, mood, stress) allowing us to identify and adjust for confounders through correlation analysis."

**Q: Is the sample size sufficient for statistical power?**
A: "We require minimum 3 baseline + 10 intervention days. This provides 80% power to detect medium effects (d=0.5) at Œ±=0.05."

**Q: How do you handle multiple concurrent therapies?**
A: "We track therapy start dates independently. Users can mark one 'primary' therapy for clean DiD analysis while continuing others."

## üöÄ Assessment Checklist

2. **Machine Learning**: Predict therapy effectiveness for new users
3. **RDD Implementation**: Add Regression Discontinuity Design for threshold effects
4. **Propensity Score Matching**: Match similar users for comparison
5. **API Development**: RESTful API for data access
6. **Multi-user Analytics**: Aggregate insights across users (anonymized)

## üîó Resources

- **App Location**: `app/app_v16_final.py`
- **Running**: `streamlit run app/app_v16_final.py`
- **URL**: http://localhost:8501
- **Demo Mode**: Click "Try Demo" on landing page

## üìù Limitations & Assumptions

1. **Temporal Causality**: Assumes therapy start date is accurate
2. **No Control Group**: This is N-of-1 (single subject) design
3. **Selection Bias**: Users self-select therapies (not randomized)
4. **Compliance**: Assumes users follow therapy as intended
5. **External Validity**: Results specific to individual user

These are standard limitations of N-of-1 trials and should be acknowledged in presentation.
