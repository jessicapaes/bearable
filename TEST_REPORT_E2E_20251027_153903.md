## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Test Environment
- ⚠️ **Email Verification Bypassed** - Tests use direct database insertion
- ℹ️ **Automated Data Generation** - Real users would have more variability
- ℹ️ **Idealized Improvement Curve** - Test data shows consistent improvement

### Production Considerations
- 📧 Email verification required for real users
- 🔐 Password reset flow not tested
- 📱 Mobile responsiveness not tested in this suite
- 🌐 API rate limiting not tested (Evidence Explorer)

---

## 🎯 Recommendations

### ✅ Ready for Production
- User authentication system is robust
- Data storage and retrieval working correctly
- RLS policies properly configured
- Statistical analysis is accurate

### 🔧 Suggested Improvements
1. **Email Verification Testing** - Add automated email confirmation tests
2. **Error Handling** - More comprehensive error scenario testing
3. **Edge Cases** - Test with missing data, invalid inputs
4. **Load Testing** - Test with 100+ users and 1000+ entries
5. **API Integration** - Verify Evidence Explorer API calls
