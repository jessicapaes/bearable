## ✅ What We've Accomplished

All AI features have been successfully integrated into the app! Here's what's available:

### 🎯 AI Features Implemented:

1. **🔬 Therapy Explainer** - Click "🤖 Explain" button on any therapy in Evidence Explorer
2. **💬 AI Symptom Logger** - Natural language input for daily logs ("I slept 5 hours, pain is 7/10...")
3. **🤖 AI Assistant Chat** - Full conversational AI assistant (dedicated tab)
4. **⚡ Rate Limiting** - 50 API calls per day (resets at midnight)
5. **💾 Smart Caching** - Therapy explanations cached for 24 hours
6. **⚙️ AI Toggle** - Enable/disable AI features in Settings
7. **📊 Usage Tracking** - Monitor API calls and estimated costs

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: For This Session Only (Temporary)

The API key is already set for the current running app! Just visit:
**http://localhost:8501**

**AI features are now active!** 🎉

### Option 2: Permanent Setup (Recommended)

To make the API key permanent, you need to create a `.env` file:

1. **Create a file named `.env`** in the project root directory:
   ```
   C:\Users\User\OneDrive\Education\AI Tech Institute Course\Repositories\painreliefmap\.env
   ```

2. **Add this content to `.env`:**
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
   ```

3. **Restart the app:**
   ```powershell
   python -m streamlit run app/app_v6_auth.py
   ```

## 📱 Using AI Features

### 🔬 Evidence Explorer
- Browse therapies by condition
- Click **"🤖 Explain"** on any therapy card
- Get detailed, personalized explanations
- Explanations are cached to save API calls

### 🌱 Daily Log
1. Click **"💬 Chat with AI Logger"**
2. Type naturally: "Had a rough night, slept 4 hours. Pain is 7/10, feeling stressed."
3. Review the AI-parsed data
4. Edit if needed and save

### 🤖 AI Assistant

### ⚙️ Settings
- Toggle AI features on/off
- Monitor your API usage (50 calls/day limit)
- See estimated costs
- Clear cache to reset therapy explanations

## 💰 Cost Estimates

- **Model Used:** GPT-3.5-turbo (most cost-effective)
- **Rate Limit:** 50 calls per day
- **Estimated Cost:** ~$0.10 per day (worst case)
- **Monthly Estimate:** ~$3.00 (if using all 50 calls daily)
- **Actual cost will likely be lower** due to caching and moderate usage

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- ✅ API key stored in environment variables (not in code)
- ✅ Only anonymized health data sent to OpenAI
- ✅ No personal identifying information shared
- ✅ All data stays on your device (except AI queries)
- ✅ Therapy explanations cached locally

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### AI Features Not Working?

1. **Check Settings Tab:**
   - Go to "⚙️ Settings"
   - Look for "✅ OpenAI API key is configured!"
   - If you see "⚠️ AI features are disabled", the API key isn't loaded

2. **Verify Environment Variable:**
   ```powershell
   # Check if it's set
   $env:OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```

3. **Create .env File:**
   - Follow "Option 2: Permanent Setup" above
   - Make sure the file is named `.env` (with the dot at the start)
   - Place it in the project root directory

4. **Restart the App:**
   - Stop the app (Ctrl+C in terminal)
   - Start it again: `python -m streamlit run app/app_v6_auth.py`

### Rate Limit Reached?

- **Solution:** Wait until midnight for the daily reset
- **Check Usage:** Go to Settings → AI Features to see remaining calls
- **Alternative:** Use traditional forms (AI is optional!)
