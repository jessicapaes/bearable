# Bearable v27 - 10-Minute Presentation Script

## 🎯 Overview
**Total Time:** 10 minutes  
**Audience:** Technical stakeholders, investors, healthcare professionals  
**Goal:** Demonstrate the value and technical sophistication of Bearable

---

## 🎬 SECTION 1: The Problem (30 seconds)

### What to Say:

> "**Chronic health conditions affect 1 in 2 adults in the US.** But here's the challenge: When someone tries a new therapy—whether it's acupuncture, yoga, or supplements—they have no systematic way to know if it's actually working for them.
>
> They're left with three problems:
> 1. **Overwhelming research** - 500,000+ clinical trials, millions of studies
> 2. **No personal tracking** - Relying on memory alone
> 3. **No statistical proof** - Can't separate real effects from placebo
>
> **Bearable solves all three.**"

### What to Show:
- Open app on homepage
- Point to the tagline: "Evidence-Based Health Tracking"

**Time Check:** ✅ 30 seconds

## 🖥️ SECTION 2: Live Walkthrough (3 minutes)

### Part A: Evidence Explorer (60 seconds)

#### What to Say:
> "Let's say you have chronic pain and want to explore natural therapies. Click on **Evidence Explorer**."

**[Navigate to Evidence Explorer tab]**

> "This isn't static data—**this is live, real-time data from ClinicalTrials.gov and PubMed APIs**. Watch this..."

**[Select 'Chronic Pain' condition and 'Acupuncture' therapy]**

> "The app just queried two government databases in real-time:
> - **ClinicalTrials.gov**: Shows 487 clinical trials
> - **PubMed**: Shows 2,300+ research articles
> - **Evidence Level**: Positive—meaning the science supports it
>
> And this data is cached intelligently—24-hour refresh cycle keeps it current while respecting API rate limits."

**[Scroll to show therapy cards]**

> "Each therapy shows:
> - Evidence strength
> - Number of trials
> - Direct links to research
> - Natural therapy definitions
>
> You can filter by 30+ conditions and 24+ natural therapies."

**Time Check:** ✅ 1 minute 30 seconds total

---

### Part B: Daily Wellness Log (60 seconds)

#### What to Say:
> "Now, evidence is great, but personal data is where the magic happens. Let's go to **Daily Log**."

**[Navigate to Daily Log tab]**

> "This takes 30 seconds a day. You track:
> - **Pain, sleep, mood** - The core three
> - **Physical symptoms** - Movement, digestion
> - **Emotional state** - Anxiety, stress
> - **Therapies used** - What you tried today
>
> The key feature? **This checkbox.**"

**[Point to 'Started new primary natural therapy today']**

> "When you start a new therapy—let's say acupuncture—you check this box. The app now knows: 'Track symptoms BEFORE and AFTER starting this therapy.'
>
> This enables true **N-of-1 trials**—personal experiments with statistical rigor."

**[Show 'Duplicate yesterday' and 'Quick Actions']**

> "And we made it effortless:
> - Duplicate yesterday's entry
> - Add quick notes
> - Track menstrual cycle (optional)
>
> All data auto-saves to the cloud securely."

**Time Check:** ✅ 2 minutes 30 seconds total

---

### Part C: Personal Dashboard & Analysis (60 seconds)

#### What to Say:
> "After you've tracked for a few weeks, go to **Dashboard**."

**[Navigate to Dashboard tab - show demo data]**

> "This is where Bearable becomes powerful. Look at this analysis:"

**[Point to therapy effect card]**

> "The app detected that I started acupuncture therapy. It automatically:
> - Compared 7 days **before** starting
> - Analyzed 23 days **after** starting
> - Calculated statistical significance using **bootstrap analysis**
> - Measured the effect size (Cohen's d)
>
> The result? **'Results Look Reliable'** with a green checkmark—meaning this is statistically significant, not placebo.
>
> **Pain decreased by 32%**, and the app says **'95% confident this is real'**."

**[Scroll to show charts]**

> "The visualizations show:
> - 14-day trend lines
> - The exact day therapy started (marked with 🧘🏻‍♀️)
> - Pain, sleep, and mood correlations
>
> **This is scientific proof** of what works for YOU."

**[Point to correlation section if time permits]**

> "It even discovers relationships: 'Strong link between better sleep and lower pain.'"

**Time Check:** ✅ 3 minutes 30 seconds total

## 🎯 SECTION 5: Q&A Preparation (5 minutes reserved)

### Anticipated Questions & Answers

#### Q: "How is this different from other health tracking apps?"

**A:** "Three key differences:
1. **Live scientific evidence** - Real-time data from government databases, not static articles
2. **Statistical rigor** - Bootstrap analysis, confidence intervals, not just charts
3. **Evidence + Personal data** - See what science says AND what works for you, in one place"

---

#### Q: "What's your business model?"

**A:** "Currently open source for community benefit. Potential models:
- **Freemium**: Basic free, advanced analytics paid
- **Healthcare partnerships**: White-label for clinics/hospitals
- **Research licensing**: Aggregate anonymized data for studies
- **Enterprise**: Team accounts for research institutions"

---

#### Q: "How do you handle data privacy?"

**A:** "Security is paramount:
- **Row-level security**: Database-level isolation
- **Encryption**: At rest and in transit
- **GDPR compliant**: Export/delete on demand
- **Open source**: Verify for yourself
- **No data selling**: Your health data is YOURS
- Passed comprehensive security audit (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF - all protected)"

---

#### Q: "What about FDA approval or medical claims?"

**A:** "Important distinction:
- We're a **tracking and analytics tool**, not a medical device
- We don't diagnose or prescribe
- We help users discover personal patterns and correlations
- Always recommend consulting healthcare providers
- Similar regulatory category to fitness trackers"

---

#### Q: "Can it integrate with wearables like Apple Watch?"

**A:** "Great question—it's on our roadmap (v28-v29):
- Apple Health integration
- Fitbit, Oura Ring, Whoop
- Automatic sleep/activity import
- Manual override always available
- Current version: Manual entry (30 seconds/day)"

---

#### Q: "How accurate are the clinical trial numbers?"

**A:** "Very accurate—direct from the source:
- **ClinicalTrials.gov**: Official US government registry, updated daily
- **PubMed**: National Library of Medicine, gold standard
- **Live APIs**: Real-time queries, 24-hour cache
- **Transparent**: Show data sources, users can verify
- **Fallback**: CSV backup ensures reliability"

---

#### Q: "What's your user traction?"

**A:** [Update with your actual numbers]
"Just launched v27 with live API integration. Early feedback:
- [X] beta testers
- [X] daily active users
- [X]% retention rate
- Targeting chronic pain, fibromyalgia, endometriosis communities initially"

---

#### Q: "What's next on the roadmap?"

**A:** "**v28 (Next 30 days):**
- NCBI API key (10x faster PubMed queries)
- Email validation & password strength
- Batch CSV import

**v29-30 (Next 90 days):**
- Wearable device integration
- AI-powered insights
- Mobile app (React Native)
- Multi-language support

**Long-term:**
- Team/family accounts (share with doctor)
- Community insights (anonymized aggregate data)
- Predictive modeling"

---

#### Q: "How long does someone need to track before seeing results?"

**A:** "Depends on therapy and individual:
- **Minimum**: 10 days (3 before, 7 after therapy start)
- **Recommended**: 30 days for statistical confidence
- **Best**: 60+ days for pattern detection
- App works with incomplete data—tracks what you provide
- The more data, the stronger the statistical confidence"

---

#### Q: "Can it track multiple therapies at once?"

**A:** "Yes! Two modes:
1. **Daily tracking**: Check all therapies used each day
2. **N-of-1 analysis**: Focus on one primary therapy at a time for before/after comparison
- You can run multiple N-of-1s sequentially
- Dashboard shows all tracked therapies
- Future version: Compare multiple therapies simultaneously"

---

#### Q: "Is this only for natural therapies?"

**A:** "Currently focused on natural therapies (yoga, acupuncture, supplements) because:
- Less regulated than pharmaceuticals
- Often overlooked in traditional healthcare
- High patient interest, variable evidence
- HOWEVER: The tracking works for ANY therapy
- Users can log medications, physical therapy, etc.
- Framework extends to all health interventions"
