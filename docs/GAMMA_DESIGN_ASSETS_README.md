## üÜò Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Gamma doesn't apply brand colors
- **Solution**: Manually set theme colors in Gamma settings after import

**Problem:** Bear logo looks pixelated
- **Solution**: Use the SVG files (not PNG) - they scale perfectly

**Problem:** Videos won't upload
- **Solution**: Convert to MP4, compress if over 100MB, or host on YouTube/Vimeo and embed

**Problem:** Text is hard to read
- **Solution**: Increase contrast - use white on purple or dark gray on white only
