## 🔍 Data Structure Verification

### Account Data Format ✅ PASSED

**Required Fields:**
- ✅ `name`: User's full name
- ✅ `username`: User's email (same as email)
- ✅ `password`: Plain text password (NOTE: Should be hashed in production)
- ✅ `email`: User's email address

**Data Consistency:**
- ✅ Username always matches email
- ✅ All fields present for new accounts
- ✅ Backward compatibility with old format (hashed passwords)

---

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Current Implementation:
- ⚠️ **Passwords stored in plain text** - For demo/development only
- ✅ Email validation prevents invalid emails
- ✅ Password minimum length enforced (6 characters)
- ✅ Duplicate email prevention
- ✅ Session state properly managed

### Production Recommendations:
1. **Hash passwords** using bcrypt or similar
2. **Add email verification** via confirmation emails
3. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent brute force attacks
4. **Add HTTPS** for production deployment
5. **Implement password strength requirements** (uppercase, numbers, symbols)
6. **Add "Remember Me" functionality** with secure tokens
7. **Implement account recovery** via email
8. **Add two-factor authentication** for enhanced security
