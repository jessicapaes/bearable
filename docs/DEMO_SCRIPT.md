## üìã Demo Script (7 minutes)

### **Slide 1: Opening Hook** (30 seconds)
> "How many of you have tried a new therapy or treatment and wondered: **Is this actually working, or is it just in my head?**
>
> That's the problem Bearable solves. We use causal inference to give people **evidence-based answers** about their health interventions."

**[SHOW: Landing page]**

---

### **Slide 2: The Problem** (45 seconds)
> "Traditional health tracking apps show you pretty charts, but they can't answer the most important question: **What's causing the change?**
>
> - Correlation ‚â† Causation
> - Placebo effects are real
> - Natural healing happens over time
>
> We need **causal analysis** to separate signal from noise."

**[SHOW: Still on landing page, scroll to features section]**

### **Slide 3: Enter Demo Mode** (30 seconds)
> "Let me show you how Bearable works. I'll enter Demo Mode which has pre-populated data showing a realistic N-of-1 trial."

**[ACTION: Click "Try Demo" button]**

**[SHOW: Dashboard loads with data]**

---

### **Slide 4: Dashboard Overview** (1 minute)
> "First, the dashboard gives you an at-a-glance view of your health metrics."

**[POINT TO: Three gauge charts]**
> - "Pain level: 3.5/10"
> - "Sleep hours: 6.8h"
> - "Mood score: 8.2/10"
>
> "Each gauge shows the current value and delta from your baseline. Green means improvement."

**[SCROLL TO: 30-Day Trend Chart]**
> "This timeline shows how metrics change over time. Notice the purple line? That marks when we started Yoga therapy. This is crucial for our causal analysis."

---

### **Slide 5: Causal Analysis - THE KEY SECTION** (2.5 minutes)
**[SCROLL TO: "Causal Analysis: What's Actually Working?" section]**

> "Here's where Bearable stands apart. We're using **Difference-in-Differences methodology** - a gold-standard causal inference technique.
>
> Let me explain what we're seeing for Yoga therapy:"

**[POINT TO: Therapy effectiveness card]**

#### Effect Size
> "**Effect Size: Large** - Cohen's d of 2.03. In statistics, anything above 0.8 is considered a large effect. This therapy has a substantial impact."

#### Statistical Significance
> "**‚úì Statistically Significant** - P-value of 0.001. That means there's less than 0.1% chance this is random variation. This is real."

#### Pain Reduction
> "**4.5 point reduction** - That's a 56% decrease in pain from baseline. Clinically meaningful."

#### Confidence Interval
> "**95% CI: [-4.9, -4.1]** - We're 95% confident the true effect is between 4.1 and 4.9 points. The interval doesn't cross zero, confirming significance."

#### Data Quality
> "**7 ‚Üí 23 days** - We had 7 days of baseline data before starting, and 23 days of follow-up. Sufficient for robust analysis."

**[SCROLL DOWN: Show before/after summary]**
> "Breaking it down:
> - Before therapy: Average pain = 8.0/10
> - After therapy: Average pain = 3.5/10
> - Net effect: 4.5 point reduction
>
> That's clear evidence this therapy is working."

---

### **Slide 6: Visual Comparisons** (1 minute)
**[POINT TO: Box plots on left]**
> "These box plots show the distribution of pain scores. Before therapy, pain was consistently high around 8. After therapy, it dropped to 3-4 with much less variation. The distributions barely overlap - strong evidence."

**[POINT TO: Timeline chart on right]**
> "This timeline makes it visual. Red dots = before period. Green dots = after period. The intervention point is marked. You can see the step change when Yoga started."

---

### **Slide 7: Correlation Analysis** (45 seconds)
**[SCROLL TO: Correlation Matrix]**
> "This heatmap reveals relationships between all metrics.
>
> - **Sleep vs Pain**: -0.79 correlation. Strong negative relationship. More sleep = less pain.
> - **Mood vs Pain**: -0.68 correlation. Better mood correlates with lower pain.
>
> This helps identify confounders and multivariate patterns."

---

### **Slide 8: Automated Insights** (30 seconds)
**[SCROLL TO: Key Insights section]**
> "Finally, Bearable generates personalized recommendations:
>
> - 'Your pain has decreased by 4.4 points - keep up what you're doing!'
> - 'Better sleep appears to reduce your pain - prioritize sleep hygiene!'
>
> Actionable insights based on YOUR data."

---

### **Slide 9: Wrap-up** (30 seconds)
**[NAVIGATE: Back to top of dashboard]**

> "So that's Bearable. We combine:
> - ‚úÖ **Rigorous causal inference** (DiD methodology)
> - ‚úÖ **Statistical validation** (p-values, CIs, effect sizes)
> - ‚úÖ **Clear visualizations** (gauges, timelines, heatmaps)
> - ‚úÖ **Automated insights** (plain-language recommendations)
>
> All to answer one question: **What's actually working?**
>
> Questions?"

## üéØ Q&A Preparation (3 minutes)

### Expected Questions & Answers

#### Q: "Why DiD instead of just comparing before/after?"
**A**: "Great question! Simple before/after can't distinguish therapy effects from:
- Natural healing over time
- Regression to the mean
- Seasonal changes
- Placebo effects

DiD controls for these time trends by establishing a baseline trajectory and measuring deviation from it."

---

#### Q: "What about confounding variables?"
**A**: "We address this in three ways:
1. **Comprehensive data collection** - We track sleep, mood, stress, not just pain
2. **Correlation analysis** - The heatmap identifies potential confounders
3. **User controls** - Users log when they start therapies, creating natural experiments

For a full RCT-level design, we'd need a control group, but for N-of-1 trials, this is the gold standard."

---

#### Q: "How much data do you need for valid results?"
**A**: "Minimum 3 days baseline + 10 days intervention for statistical power of 80% to detect medium effects (d=0.5) at Œ±=0.05.

The app tracks this and tells users 'Need X more days' if insufficient. Our demo has 7 baseline + 23 intervention days - very robust."

---

#### Q: "What if someone is on multiple therapies at once?"
**A**: "Two approaches:
1. **Independent analysis** - We analyze each therapy separately with its own start date
2. **Primary therapy marker** - Users can designate one 'primary' therapy for clean DiD analysis

In future versions, we'd add multivariate regression to tease apart combined effects."

---

#### Q: "Is this as good as a clinical trial?"
**A**: "It's different - this is N-of-1 methodology. Strengths:
- ‚úÖ Personalized to individual biology
- ‚úÖ Accounts for unique circumstances
- ‚úÖ Practical and achievable for users

Limitations:
- ‚ùå No control group (single subject)
- ‚ùå No randomization (user-selected therapies)
- ‚ùå Results don't generalize to populations

But for personal health decisions, N-of-1 is often more relevant than population averages from RCTs."

---

#### Q: "Could you add machine learning predictions?"
**A**: "Absolutely! Natural extensions:
1. **Predictive modeling** - 'Based on similar users, Yoga has 78% chance of working for you'
2. **Therapy recommendations** - 'Users like you found acupuncture effective'
3. **Outcome forecasting** - 'If you continue, expect 6.2/10 pain in 30 days'

We focused on causal inference first because understanding **why** something works is more valuable than just predicting it will work."

---

#### Q: "What about the technical stack?"
**A**: "Built with:
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python) for rapid prototyping
- **Data Pipeline**: Pandas for analysis
- **Statistics**: SciPy, NumPy for t-tests, bootstrap, correlations
- **Visualization**: Plotly for interactive charts
- **Storage**: JSON (MVP), easily upgradable to PostgreSQL

Deployed on localhost for demo, but Streamlit Cloud ready for production."

---

#### Q: "Show me the code for DiD calculation"
**A**: "Sure! The core function is around line 813:

```python
def calculate_therapy_effect(df, therapy_name, metric="pain_score"):
    # Find therapy start date
    therapy_start = df[df['therapy_started'] == therapy_name]['date'].min()

    # Split data
    before = df[df['date'] < therapy_start]
    after = df[df['date'] >= therapy_start]

    # Calculate effect
    before_mean = before[metric].mean()
    after_mean = after[metric].mean()
    effect = after_mean - before_mean

    # Statistical tests
    t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(before[metric], after[metric])

    # Effect size (Cohen's d)
    cohens_d = abs(effect) / pooled_std

    # Bootstrap confidence intervals
    # ... 1000 iterations with replacement

    return results
```

It's clean, well-documented, and follows statistical best practices."

## üé¨ Backup Plans

### If Demo Mode Doesn't Work:
1. **Manual Entry**: Create new account, show Daily Log form, explain what it would look like after 30 days
2. **Backup Video**: Play pre-recorded 3-minute demo video
3. **Code Walkthrough**: Show the `calculate_therapy_effect` function and explain the logic

### If Questions Get Technical:
- "Great question! I can show you the exact code..." (have GitHub repo ready)
- "That's in our roadmap for v2..." (pivot to future features)
- "The full technical documentation is in my GitHub repo..."

### If Questions Challenge Methodology:
- Stay humble: "You're right, that's a limitation of N-of-1 design..."
- Acknowledge tradeoffs: "We optimized for personal utility over population generalizability..."
- Redirect to strengths: "But for individual health decisions, this is more relevant than..."
